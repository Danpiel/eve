== DESCRIPTION:

A Ruby library for interfacing with all aspects of the EVE Online MMO. It is designed for use within a Ruby on Rails
project, but does not require Rails as a dependency. That means there's nothing preventing you from writing a
stand-alone application or script using this library.

This package is divided into 3 major components, and are listed below. Click on any item to see more information and
usage examples.

* {API libraries}[link:classes/Eve/API.html]
  * Handles interfacing with the EVE Online API. It allows you to easily query the server for various information about
    the server status, a given player, or his/her in-game character.
  * Eventually, this may be extended to incorporate other EVE-related APIs, such as the EVE-Central and EVE Metrics
    APIs.

* Controller helpers (+ApplicationController+)
  * There are several helper methods added to ApplicationController, and they are designed to facilitate interaction
    with the in-game browser (IGB). In particular, these helpers allow you to establish trust with the client browser,
    which will then provide more information about the player's current in-game status (such as his/her current
    location).
  * The controller helpers also automatically detect whether the client is, in fact, using the EVE IGB, or whether they
    are using some other browser. If a view with the ".igb.erb" extension is found, the controller will render that view
    by default for IGB clients. If the client is using some other browser, or a view with the ".igb.erb" extension is
    not found, then the default view will be rendered instead.
  * To take advantage of these helpers, your application must extend ApplicationController, which is a default in Ruby
    on Rails.

* View helpers (+Eve::Helpers+)
  * There are several helper methods added to ActionView, and they are designed to facilitate easy and intuitive
    generation of proprietary IGB JavaScript calls.
  * These helpers are automatically made accessible to all instances of ActionView::Base.
  * To take advantage of these helpers, your application must make use of ActionView::Base, which is the default in Ruby
    on Rails.

== FEATURES/PROBLEMS:

* Still in development. Maybe, what, 85% done?
